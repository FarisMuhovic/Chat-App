### WORK IN PROGRESS

# Chat-App
Chat app that prioritizes privacy and anonymity. The design is minimalistic and simple to use .The messages disappear 10/15/30 seconds after they're have been seen and deleted from client and server(database)

The goal is to make chatting more locally and not globally within ur community, that way the security and control is increased.
Chat users can add each other using a QR code that they scan which leaves no trace of connection.
The chats wont be saved but after being read they will be deleted from the database and client in 
a specific time interval requested by the user.
